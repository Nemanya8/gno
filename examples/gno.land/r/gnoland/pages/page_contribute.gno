# Contributor Ecosystem: Call for Contributions 

gno.land puts at the center of its identity the contributors that help to create and shape the project into what it is; incentivizing those who contribute the most and help advance its vision. Eventually, contributions will be incentivized directly on-chain; in the meantime, this page serves to illustrate our current off-chain initiatives.

gno.land is still in full-steam development. For now, we're looking for the earliest of adopters; curious to explore a new way to build smart contracts and eager to make an impact. Joining gno.land's development now means you can help to shape the base of its development ecosystem, which will pave the way for the next generation of blockchain programming.

If you are interested in contributing to gno.land, you can jump on in on our [GitHub monorepo](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - where most development happens. Additionally, you can look out to help on specific issues labeled as bounties. All contributions will then concur to form your profile for Game of Realms. In the following sections, we delve into these initiatives in a bit more detail. 


## Gno Bounties

The Gno bounty program is a good way to familiarize yourself with the project, and how Gno code works. We will maintain open and rewardable bounties in the Gnolang repository, and you can search all available bounties by using the ["bounty" label](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/labels/bounty).

Recommendations on participating in the gno.land Bounty Program:
- Identify the bounty you want to work on, and first start working in your local environment.
- Once you have spent time on the code related to the bounty, we recommend submitting a 'draft' PR as soon as possible. 
    - The draft PR doesn't indicate that the bounty has been assigned to you, others are free to work on other draft PRs for the bounty. 
    - After submitting the 'draft' PR, continue working until you are ready to mark the PR as "ready for review". 
    - The core team will review the bounty PR submission, and determine if it qualifies for the bounty reward.

You may make your submission at any time; however we invite you to publish your draft PR very early in the development process. This will make your work public, so you can easily get help by the core team and other community members. Additionally, your work can be continued by other people should you get stuck or no longer be willing to work on the bounty. Likewise, you can continue the abandoned or stuck work that someone else worked on. Don't fear your work being "stolen": if a submission is the result of multiple people's efforts, we will look to split the bounty in a way that is fair and recognises each participant in creating the final outcome.

Participants in the gno.land Bounty Program must meet the legal Terms and Conditions referenced [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXrZ6japdAykB5FLmHCCeBZTo-2tbZQHSQi79ITaTK0/edit). 

## gno.land Grants 

The gno.land grants program is to encourage and support the growth of the gno.land contributor community, and build out the usability of the platform and smart contract library. The program provides financial resources to contributors to explore the Gno tech stack, and build dApps, tooling, infrastructure, products, and smart contract libraries in gno.land.

## Join Game of Realms

Game of Realms is the overarching contributor network of gnomes, currently running off-chain, and will eventually transition on-chain. At this stage, a Game of Realm's contribution is comprised of high-impact contributions identified as 'notable contributions'. 

These contributions are not linked to immediate financial rewards, but are notable in nature, in the sense they are a challenge, make a significant addition to the project, and require persistence, with minimal feedback loops from the core team. 

You can always contribute to the project, and all contributions will be noticed. Contributing now is a way to build your personal contributor profile in gno.land early on in the ecosystem, and signal your commitment to the project, the community, and its future. 

There are a variety of ways to make your contributions count:
- Core code contributions
- Realm development 
- Validator tooling 
- Developer tooling

How will notable contributions in Game of Realms be selected?

The selection of a notable contribution or the sum of contributions that equal 'notable' is based on the impact it has on the development of the project. For now, it is focused on code contributions, and will evolve over time. The Gno development teams will initially qualify and evaluate notable contributions, and vote off-chain on adding them to the 'notable contributions' folder on GitHub. 

To start, we recommend you create an issue in the Game of Realms [repository](https://github.com/gnolang/game-of-realms) to serve as a profile page of all your contributions.
